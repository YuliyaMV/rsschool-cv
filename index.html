      <td>Hi! Thank you for your kind attention to my CV:) Very nice to meet you! A few words about me: I have a sincere and open personality both at work and in daily life. I always prefer to deal with specific tasks, set concrete goals, and systematically strugle for them. I like working in teams. However, as experience has shown, I can successfully cope with tasks individually. I always work at full strength if I see a fair reward for this.</td>
